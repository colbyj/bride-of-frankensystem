==================================================

Welcome to Bride of Frankensystem's documentation! If you're just getting started, start with the :doc:`getting_started/overview` to understand what BOFS is and how it can help your research.

`Bride of Frankensystem <https://frankensystem.net>`_ (BOFS) is an open-source framework designed specifically for behavioral researchers who need more flexibility than survey platforms offer, but don't want to build everything from scratch.
