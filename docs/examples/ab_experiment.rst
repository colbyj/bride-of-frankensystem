A/B Experiment Example
=====================

.. note::
    This is a placeholder page. Content will be added in a future update.
    
    This page will demonstrate how to set up a complete A/B testing experiment using BOFS, including:
    
    - Condition assignment and balancing
    - Condition-specific content display
    - Data collection and analysis
    - Complete example project files
    
    For now, see the conditional routing section in :doc:`../getting_started/project_configuration` for basic condition setup.


This example source code will include:

- Basic questionnaire with two conditions
- Conditional routing in config file
- Making use of the condition in a static file
- Adding a blueprint and a custom view
