Changes from 1.2 to 2.0
=======================

Core Changes
* Removed support for Python 2.7.x
* Changes to support the lastest Flask version and latest SQLAlchemy.
* [New documentation](https://docs.frankensystem.net/).
* Updated all JS libraries.
* Consent text is now read in from a `consent.html` file next to the configuration file instead of from the configuration file.
* Added "BOFS" command to start projects instead of needing a separate `run.py` file.
* No more need for the "app" directory to be a part of the project.
* Use `flask-compress` to serve brotli and gz files (e.g., for Unity WebGL builds).
* Improved auto-reload feature that now works with templates.
* Export code rewritten to minimize the chance of throwing exceptions.
* Simple error messages will now show up if in production mode, rather than a generic 500 error.
* If not in debug mode, save any 500 errors to a log file.
* When project stats, check for missing DB columns from tables and questionnaires and add them (only works with SQLite).
* Detect web scrapers and if found exclude them from the condition counts and progress page.
* Many bug fixes.

Project Configuration Options
* Can now specify a specific completion code, or redirect users to an external URL upon reading `/end`.
* `/start_mturk` route is now `/external_id`.
* Can now configure what the prompt on `/external_id` says.
* If `PROLIFIC_PID` is passed in as a URL parameter, the session variable is set and the input field on `/external_id` is automatically populated with the value passed.
* Conditions are now defined with labels and can be disabled selectively; labels show on progress page and are used in the export instead of the numbers.
* Can now configure `ABANDONED_MINUTES` and `COUNTS_INCLUDE_ABANDONED`, relating to ignoring participants who abandoned the task when considering participant counts within conditions.

Administration
* Can now download SQLite database from admin panel as well as clear it out.
* Admin panel styling changes.
* Admin login now redirects user to where they were trying to go instead of always redirecting to the progress page.
* Added the ability to selectively indicate individual participants to exclude from the participant counts.
* Added a results page to the admin panel to view summary statistics of any numeric data.

Tables, Questionnaires, and Blueprints
* Can define custom exports within the [JSON-defined tables](https://docs.frankensystem.net/en/latest/tables.html).
* Can now use 'HAVING' clauses in custom exports.
* Can now configure default value of sliders.
* Some slight improvements to how the questionnaires are rendered on mobile devices.
* `/table` POST route now understands JSON data.
* Blueprints no longer need a `views.py` file to be included.
* Can now have ["simple" html pages](https://docs.frankensystem.net/en/latest/simple_pages.html), that support templates but can be shown without any additional Python code.
* It is now possible to define [custom question types](https://docs.frankensystem.net/en/latest/questionnaires/custom_questions.html) to use within questionnaires.
* Can put questionnaire and tables inside of blueprint folders
